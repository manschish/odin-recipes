    <h4><em>Descriptiom</em></h4>
    <p> Hyderabadi chicken biryani features tender pieces of chicken marinated in a blend of yogurt, spices, and herbs.
        The chicken is usually layered with partially cooked basmati rice that has been infused with saffron, fried
        onions, mint, and cilantro. This layering technique allows the flavors to meld together as the biryani cooks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dish is typically cooked in a sealed pot over low heat, allowing the steam to gently cook the rice and
        chicken until both are tender and infused with the spices. This slow cooking process is crucial for developing
        the rich flavors and textures that make Hyderabadi biryani so special.
    </p>
    Hyderabadi chicken biryani is often garnished with additional fried onions, fresh herbs, and lemon wedges before
    serving. It is commonly accompanied by raita, a yogurt-based condiment, and salan, a spicy gravy made with chili
    peppers, tomatoes, and spices, to complement its bold flavors.</p>

    <h4>
        <em>Steps</em>
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder,
                    turmeric powder, garam masala, coriander powder, cumin powder, salt, and lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Mix the marinade thoroughly, ensuring that all the chicken pieces are coated evenly. Cover the bowl and
                    let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.</li>
                <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add salt and whole spices (such as bay leaves, cinnamon
                    sticks, cardamom pods, and cloves) for flavor.</li>
                <li>Add the rinsed basmati rice to the boiling water and cook until it's about 70-80% done (parboiled). The
                    rice grains should be firm but not fully cooked. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or deep baking dish, heat cooking oil or ghee over medium heat. Add sliced
                    onions and cook until they turn golden brown and caramelized. Remove half of the fried onions and set
                    aside for garnish.</li>
                <li>Layer the marinated chicken evenly over the fried onions in the pot. Sprinkle a layer of chopped mint
                    leaves, cilantro leaves, and green chilies over the chicken.</li>
                <li>Spread the partially cooked rice evenly over the chicken layer. Optionally, drizzle saffron milk over
                    the rice for added fragrance and color. Top with the remaining fried onions.</li>
                <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with aluminum foil to trap the steam. Reduce the heat
                    to low and let the biryani cook for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the
                    chicken to cook through.</li>
                <li>Once done, remove the pot from the heat and let it rest, covered, for another 10 minutes to allow the
                    biryani to settle.</li>
                <li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers before serving. Garnish with additional fried
                    onions and lemon wedges if desired. Serve hot with raita and salan on the side.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
